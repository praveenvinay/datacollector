# iTop Data Collector base for Microsoft Azure and Graph

## About

iTop data collectors are simple PHP command line applications to collect data from an external application and load/synchronize the
 information into [iTop](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop) using the data synchronization mechanism built into iTop.

This module brings base elements to the extra part used to collect data from Microsoft Azure or Microsoft Graph computing environments. It needs 
[the collector base module](https://github.com/Combodo/itop-data-collector-base) together with [the data collector for Microsoft Azure ](https://github.com/Combodo/itop-data-collector-ms-azure) 
or [the data collector for Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/Combodo/itop-data-collector-ms-graph) to work.
