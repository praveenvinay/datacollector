 information into [iTop](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop) using the data synchronization mechanism built into iTop.

This module is the extra part to collect data from Microsoft Azure computing environment. It needs the 
[data collector base for Microsoft Azure and Graph](https://github.com/Combodo/itop-data-collector-ms-azure) as well as the 
[collector base module](https://github.com/Combodo/itop-data-collector-base) to work.
